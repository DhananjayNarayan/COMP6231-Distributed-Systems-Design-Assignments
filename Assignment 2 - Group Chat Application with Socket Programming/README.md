## Assignment 2 - Group Chat Application with Socket Programming

For this assignment, we have to code a group chat room. In this chat room, clients connect to a remote server with a designated IP and port number. 
The server accepts connections from an arbitrary number of clients. 
Any message sent from one client is broadcast to all other clients. 
Concepts of socket programming and multi-threading are used to achieve this task.
