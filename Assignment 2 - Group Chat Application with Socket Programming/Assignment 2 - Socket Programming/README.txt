Assignment 2 - Socket Programming

There are two files named ClientSoc.java and ServerSoc.java
First run ServerSoc Java file. 
It will then display that the Chat Server has started and is waiting for incoming clients to connect.


Then run ClientSoc java file. 
A new console will open asking the user to enter a name. 
Running the same ClientSoc class again will open new console and ask for the second user's name.
The same steps can be repeated for how many ever clients you want to add. Each client will get a new terminal.
Once all the clients are connected, one client's message is displayed to all as in a Group Chat. 

I have also attached two screenshot images named "ChatOutputDemoUserA.jpg" and "ChatOutputDemoUserC.jpg" 
to help you understand how the output looks like when 3 users named A,B,C are connected and chatting.
A connection of client is terminated when it enters "Bye" as seen in the screenshot attached.
You can run and test the program in the same way by adding more clients.


Thank you.
